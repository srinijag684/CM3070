The amount of fake news being spread has been on the rise. Fake news can have negative real-world effects such as spreading panic among the public, encouraging unhealthy behaviours, or undermining public health initiatives as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. It could also cause mistrust in the media as people would not know which source to believe. Therefore, strong detection systems are essential to reducing these issues.
